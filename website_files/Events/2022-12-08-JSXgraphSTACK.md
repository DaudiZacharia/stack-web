# Using JSX graphs in STACK

This event is associated with the Eurasmus+ IDIAM project.

JSXGraph is a cross-browser library for displaying interactive geometry, function plotting, graphs, and data visualization in a web browser <https://jsxgraph.org/wp/index.html>. Mathematical and physical phenomena can be better understood and explored via visualization. This workshop will provide hands-on practise on how to create JSXGraphs, which you can embend in your educational resources (e.g. in markdown editor) and how to use JSXGraph in STACK assessments. 

**When:** Thursday 8th December 2022.

**Where:** The University of Edinburgh, James Clerk Maxwell building, Room 5323 (for in-person attendees) and online.

The Zoom link for online participation will get published here 2 days before the event.
