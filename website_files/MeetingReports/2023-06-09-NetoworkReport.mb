It was a good opportunity to welcome new members

## Topics Discusseed: 

**New STACK Release:** Chris presented the new STACK release, STACK 4.4.3, and demonstrated its new features. The key features of this release included improved cleaning of Unicode from students' input strings, descriptions to the question (castext), the PRT nodes, and the question tests. Additionally, an input extra option validator was introduced to allow user-defined validation functions. A new reveal block in questions was also added. It was emphasized that users should check their existing questions after updating to STACK 4.4.3, especially in relation to the changes in JSX graphs. Further details about the new features can be found in the documentation provided at https://docs.stack-assessment.org/en/Developer/Development_history/.


**Bulk Testing for STACK Update:** It was recommended that everyone who planned to update or had already updated to the new STACK version should perform bulk testing of their questions. However, not everyone had admin privileges on their local servers, making it necessary to seek assistance from the local IT team. To support colleagues who lacked admin privileges, Maciej volunteered to write guidelines for testing quizzes, which will be shared with the team.

**API, Managing Questions Outside Moodle:**
The meeting included a discussion on exploring API options for managing questions outside Moodle. While the topic proved to be highly technical, it generated interest among some participants. It was suggested to organize a dedicated meeting in the future to delve deeper into this subject. Santiago offered assistance in preparing a funding application related to this topic.

**Funding Opportunities, Grant Opportunities:**
The possibility of securing funding for professional networks was discussed. 
The meeting highlighted funding opportunities, specifically the EPSRC Responsive Mode Network Grant, which offers funding for research projects. While it may not directly align with the organization's objectives, the attendees were encouraged to explore other relevant funding bodies. A stream was created in Zulipchat to coordinate efforts in writing grant applications.

**Communications:**
Zulipchat was identified as the preferred communication platform for the organization, providing a centralized space for discussions and issue reporting. Github was emphasized as the primary platform for reporting code-related issues.

Next Meetings:
Despite the approaching summer season, it was suggested to schedule another meeting in July and another in early September. This would ensure continued progress and provide opportunities for further discussions and updates.

**Action Points:**

Maciej volunteered to write guidelines for colleagues who are not administrators on their local servers, to support them in testing their quizzes after updating to STACK 4.4.3.
Consider organizing a Github training session to demonstrate how to contribute to the STACK web platform, including adding case studies, advertising events, and updating documents. Volunteers Sam and [Your Name] expressed interest in running the training.
Assess the level of interest in API usage for managing questions outside Moodle and, if warranted, schedule a dedicated meeting to explore the topic in detail.
Explore funding opportunities beyond the EPSRC Responsive Mode Network Grant and coordinate grant application efforts via the Zulipchat stream.
Ensure ongoing communication and issue reporting through Zulipchat, while utilizing Github for code-related issues.
