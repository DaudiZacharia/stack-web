# American Institute of Mathematics meeting: Open source mathematics curriculum and assessment tools

Juma Zevick

### Introduction

The recent Workshop on Open Source Mathematics Curriculum and Assessment Tools, held from August 5 to 9, 2024, at Maseno University, Kisumu, Kenya, brought together a diverse group of educators, researchers, and technologists. Organized by Joe Champion, Franca Hoffmann, Michael Obiero, and Mary Ochieng, and sponsored by the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the workshop aimed to enhance the utility and impact of open educational technologies in the field of mathematics. The event also served as a precursor to the International STACK Conference at the Technical University of Kenya, starting on August 12, 2024.

### Overview of the Workshop

The workshop was designed to foster collaboration between creators of open-source educational tools and mathematics education researchers. With a focus on improving the effectiveness and integration of these tools into educational curricula, the event offered a platform for participants to share their experiences, challenges, and innovations.


#### Key Objectives:

1. Enhancing Integration: Discussing strategies for better integration of open-source tools with existing educational frameworks.
2. Research Collaboration: Facilitating partnerships between developers and researchers to drive innovation and practical application.
3. Data Sharing and Analysis: Exploring new avenues for sharing and analyzing educational data to improve learning outcomes.
4. Interoperability: Addressing the technical challenges of ensuring that different educational technologies can work together seamlessly.
5. Implementation Challenges: Identifying common obstacles in the adoption and effective use of these tools, and proposing solutions.


### Key Sessions and Discussions

###### Integration of Math Education Research and Technology
One of the most recurring theme was the need for closer collaboration between technologists and educators. Participants emphasized that successful integration of technology into mathematics education requires tools that not only align with curriculum standards but also adapt to the diverse needs of students. Discussions highlighted the potential for research to inform the development of more intuitive and effective tools, as well as the importance of iterative feedback loops between users and developers.

###### Data Sharing and Analysis
Another critical topic was the importance of data in shaping educational practices. Sessions focused on how data from various educational platforms can be shared, analyzed, and leveraged to inform teaching strategies and improve student performance. The participants explored different models for secure and ethical data sharing, particularly in the context of open-source tools, where transparency and community involvement are key.


###### Interoperability of Learning Platforms
The challenge of ensuring that different educational technologies can work together was a significant focus of the workshop. Participants discussed the need for standardized protocols and APIs that enable seamless integration of various tools into a cohesive learning environment. This was seen as essential for creating flexible and scalable educational solutions that can be adapted to different contexts and needs.

###### Addressing Shared Implementation Challenges
The workshop also provided a forum for participants to discuss common challenges in implementing open-source tools. These included technical issues, such as compatibility with existing infrastructure, as well as human factors, such as resistance to change and the need for professional development. The discussions emphasized the importance of community support and collaboration in overcoming these challenges.

### Outcomes and Future Directions
The workshop concluded with a set of actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing the impact of open-source educational tools in mathematics. 

Key among these was the creation of a collaborative network of educators, researchers, and developers who will continue to work together to address the challenges identified during the workshop. This network is expected to play a crucial role in driving the adoption of these tools and ensuring that they remain responsive to the evolving needs of educators and students.

Another significant outcome was the commitment to develop guidelines for best practices in the integration of technology and mathematics education research. These guidelines will serve as a valuable resource for educators and developers alike, helping to ensure that future innovations are grounded in both pedagogical research and practical experience.


### Conclusion
The Workshop on Open Source Mathematics Curriculum and Assessment Tools brought together a diverse group of stakeholders to address some of the most pressing challenges in mathematics education today. The discussions and collaborations that took place during the five day event has laid the groundwork for ongoing efforts to improve the quality and accessibility of educational technology in mathematics. As the participants look ahead to the upcoming International STACK Conference, there is a shared sense of optimism and determination to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible in mathematics education.
