# Combining STACK and GeoGebra for better feedback

### Guido Pinkernell, Heidelberg University of Education, Germany

STACK offers the possibility of Combining STACK and GeoGebra for better feedback. When placed in feedback, interactive applets allow for what could be called "activating feedback", i.e. adaptive learning material that  students to work out the necessary knowledge themselves.

The object of this task is the well-known translation of an algebraic expression into its geometric representation.

Here, GeoGebra provides an interactive applet in both STACK's task and feedback area. The latter comes in three steps, each after some delay:

* First, it allows the learner to compare her or his wrong solution with the correct, thus giving an experienced user immediate hints about his error, presumably made inadvertently.
* For those needing more help, it provides an interactive version of the situation together with questions that guide the student through working out himself how the algebraic and geometrical representations of this function relate.
* Finally, it gives access to a worked solution, thus serving those learners which rely on a stepwise instruction to solve questions like this.
