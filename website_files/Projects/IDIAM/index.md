# IDIAM: Interactive digital assessment in mathematics

The project responded to challenges faced during COVID-19 by helping partner institutions use STACK to develop a) digital tools that assess competencies within science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), particularly mathematical sciences
and b) digital assignments within several specific mathematical subjects at the partner institutions.

Based on the STACK system, the project aimed at development of a) digital tools that assess competencies within science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), particularly mathematical sciences
and b) digital assignments within several specific mathematical subjects at the partner institutions.

Outcomes from this project include

1. Release digital interactive problems in STACK for the course [Fundamentals of Algebra and Calculus](../../CaseStudies/2019/FAC/) and for [HELM](../../CaseStudies/2021/HELM/)
2. Example problems in multivariate analysis, that actively use interactive 3D-graphics to illustrate mathematical concepts within multivariate analysis. 3D graphics will be also
used to assess student's knowledge of multivariate analysis.
3. A plugin to STACK/Moodle that makes it possible to plot interactive mathematical 3D graphics.
4. Didactic studies showing how to work with several representation forms for complex mathematical concepts, such as functions, to facilitate better understanding.
