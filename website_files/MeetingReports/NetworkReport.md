# 1st STACK Network meeting report

The STACK Professionals Network was established on summer of 2022 in an attempt to bring together professionals, across various institutions, who spend a significant amount of their time authoring STACK question. 

There is a large and growing community of STACK users. The STACK assessment software is used in over 15 countries for assessing mathematics and other STEM subjects, and has been translated in 10 languages; STACK is in regular use in English, Finnish, Swedish, Japanese, German, Spanish and Portuguese.
Over the last 3 years the pandemic has boosted the need to create more online recourses and many universities have created posts for people whose main role is to author STACK questions. The Network will bring these people together and contribute to the knowledge sharing among them. 

The 1st STACK Network meeting took place at the 9th of December 2022 at the School of Mathematics in Edinburgh University. The purpose of the meeting was to bring together the people of the Network and set some initial goals for the Network. The topics that were discussed during the meeting can be divided into two categories: How the members can contribute into the STACK project and how the Network will support it's members. 

## How the Network will support it's members: 

Using STACK to automate mathematics (and STEM) assessments is requires very specialist skills, and the people who do this job most times may work in isolation in their institutions. In many cases there is only 1 person in the department/university doing this job so they don't have much help regarding various issues that they may encounter in their line of work. The Network will help the STACK professionals to solve various authoring difficulties and also make it easier to share existing questions/quizzes amongst themselves. Mathematics curriculum, especially topics like Algebra, Calculus, Differential Equations, is very similar around the globe, so many existing STACK questions can be easily shared and reused with minor edits. 

Furthermore the Network can provide training to colleagues who are new into STACK and define the pedagogy around creating STACK questions.

Another aspect of the Network is to provide a mechanism so that the work of the STACK professionals will acquire better recognition. Most of the content created by the STACK professionals is behind passwords, belongs to institutions, not to individuals, most people not necessarily contribute to any research, they don't publish papers so all this work can easily be unnoticed.


## How the members will contribute to the STACK project/ how to make it easier to contribute to STACK: 

All the STACK code and documentation is on Github and 
	1. Sharing and organising demo questions
	2. Creating templates of question
	3. Testing and maintaining questions
	4. Contributing sample questions and question banks.
	5. Translating the system and sample materials.
	6. Contributing to the documentation and examples especially knowhow on linking together features for single subjects.
