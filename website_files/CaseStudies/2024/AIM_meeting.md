Juma Zevick

### Introduction

The recent Workshop on Open Source Mathematics Curriculum and Assessment Tools, held from August 5 to 9, 2024, at Maseno University, Kisumu, Kenya, brought together a diverse group of educators, researchers, and technologists. Organized by Joe Champion, Franca Hoffmann, Michael Obiero, and Mary Ochieng, and sponsored by the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the workshop aimed to enhance the utility and impact of open educational technologies in the field of mathematics. The event also served as a precursor to the International STACK Conference at the Technical University of Kenya, starting on August 12, 2024.
