# Honours Complex Variables

Context
Honours Complex Variables is a 20 credit, level 10 course typically taken by around 250 students, mostly in Year 3. The course covers the following topics:
 
* holomorphic functions, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and multivalued functions;
* conformal maps, the extended complex plane, Riemann sphere, and Möbius transformations;
* Cauchy's Integral Theorem, and the (Generalized) Cauchy Integral Theorem;
* Liouville's Theorem and the Maximum Modulus Principle;
* Taylor and Laurent Series;
* zeros, singularities, residues, and the Cauchy Residue Theorem; and
* evaluation of real integrals using contour integrals.

The course content is based on an established set of course notes (around 80 pages) written by Dr Richard Gratwick, the current course organiser. There is no requirement for the students to buy a textbook. The notes contain the background theory, proofs, examples and some exercises for the students to practise on. These exercises are different from the ones used on the workshops, students were expected to work on them while they were studying each lecture's content. Most students though didn't attempt these exercises and only looked on the solutions which were provided every week.

Execution
In the academic year 2021-22, the course was redesigned in response to constraints imposed by pandemic restrictions. The notes were converted from a static PDF to a collection of quizzes in the STACK service. The redesign aimed to be future-proof in the sense that materials created should be suitable for reuse in subsequent years, with iterated improvements, even when a return to fully on-campus teaching is possible. This redesign was, again, influenced by the previous work fully online courses FAC/IMA (Kinnear et al., 2021; Sangwin & Kinnear, 2021a). 

These resources were created by Richard Gratwick, Steven O’Hagan and the postgraduate internes Ivona Gjeroska, Maddy Baron and Xie Jin Ng, in collaboration with Giampaolo D’Alessandro (University of Southampton).

A typical pattern of content from the resource is shown in Figure 5. We see a definition followed a short discussion and video clip of a worked example by the lecturer. Then we have a STACK question inviting the student to check their own understanding of the material. In addition, each unit of work started with a
video of the lecturer giving a high-level overview and motivation of the material to come.
