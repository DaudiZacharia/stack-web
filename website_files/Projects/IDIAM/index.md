title: "IDIAM: Interactive digital assessment in mathematics"
---

The project is aimed at development of a) digital tools that assess competencies within science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), particularly mathematical sciences
and b) digital assignments within several specific mathematical subjects at the partner institutions.
Keeping in mind complexity of the mathematical language, it is not an easy task to develop a digital teaching and assessment system that would fully guide and assess student's skills
in mathematics, however, substantial work is done in the context of STACK (the System for Teaching and Assessment using a Computer algebra Kernel). STACK is based on over a
fifteen years of research and development at several European institutions. One of the most important features of the STACK system is a possibility for differentiated feedback, such
that different students get different response, depending on their answers.
This project aims at further development of STACK as a learning assistant tool in mathematics. In the framework of the current application, we divide development into software
development work packages and pedagogic development work packages. Software development will consist of programming of several features aiming at higher interactivity, and
pedagogic development will focus on construction of interactive exercise sets in at least two of mathematical subjects that are present at each of the partner institutions. As though
STACK supports having a same question in several languages, this feature needs to and will be thoroughly tested in the project. All software and questions sets will be released under
open licenses, allowing free use in other educational institutions and countries, thus bringing added value at EU level.
Pedagogical work packages aim at development of problem sets in two focus areas within university mathematics: 1) Fundamentals of Algebra and Calculus and 2) Multivariate
analysis. All partner institutions have students that study in these areas, as though specific names of the courses may differ. Main target group is engineering students. Programming
work packages aim at software development in two focus areas: 1) interactive lightweight graphics in STACK, both 2D and 3D, and 2) Interactive adaptive questions in STACK.
Besides these goals, the project aims at expanding the community that works on digital assessment in mathematics. This will be achieved primarily by involving more faculty members
