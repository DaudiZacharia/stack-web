# Honours Complex Variables



Context
Honours Complex Variables is a 20 credit, level 10 course at the University of Edinburgh, typically taken by around 250 students, mostly in Year 3. The course covers the following topics:
 
* holomorphic functions, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and multivalued functions;
* conformal maps, the extended complex plane, Riemann sphere, and MÃ¶bius transformations;
* Cauchy's Integral Theorem, and the (Generalized) Cauchy Integral Theorem;
* Liouville's Theorem and the Maximum Modulus Principle;
* Taylor and Laurent Series;
* zeros, singularities, residues, and the Cauchy Residue Theorem; and
* evaluation of real integrals using contour integrals.

The course content is based on an established set of course notes (around 80 pages) written by Dr Richard Gratwick, the current course organiser. There is no requirement for the students to buy a textbook. The notes contain the background theory, proofs, examples and some exercises for the students to practise on. These exercises are different from the ones used on the workshops, students were expected to work on them while they were studying each lecture's content. Most students though didn't attempt these exercises and only looked on the solutions which were provided every week.
