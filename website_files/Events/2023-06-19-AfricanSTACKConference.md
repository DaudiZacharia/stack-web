# African STACK Conference for Undergraduate Mathematics

<p>The first African STACK Conference for Undergarduate Mathematics will take place at <a href="https://www.mmust.ac.ke" target="blank">Masinde Muliro University for Science and Technology (MMUST)</a> from 19 to 23 June 2023.</p>

<p>The conference aims to enable African educators with experience on STACK define a roadmap for transformation of African maths education. Since 2019, African universities started incorporating STACK assessments to their undergraduate courses, particularly to deal with issues of large class sizes (over 1,200 students in some cases) with a single lecturer and no additional human resources. A concerted effort was started by groups of universities, with the support of <a href="https://www.idems.international/" target="blank">IDEMS International</a>, to promote STACK in the region through open resources and question banks, which are slowly spreading throughout the continent, with the objective of full curriculum coverage.</p>

<p>The conference will provide a platform for lecturers to present their experiences incorporating STACK to undergraduate courses, their methodologies and impact found. Key stakeholders will have an opportunity to extend their collaboration and accelerate the integration of STACK.</p>

<p>The conference will include a 2-day STACK workshop, 2 days of presentations and discussions, and a roundtable discussion with key stakeholders.</p>
