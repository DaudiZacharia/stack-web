# IDIAM: Interactive digital assessment in mathematics

Project Start Date (yyyy-mm-dd) 2021-03-01
Project Total Duration 24 months
Project End Date (yyyy-mm-dd) 2023-02-28

The project is aimed at development of a) digital tools that assess competencies within science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), particularly mathematical sciences and b) digital assignments within several specific mathematical subjects at the partner institutions.

Programming work packages aim at software development in two focus areas: 1) interactive lightweight graphics in STACK, both 2D and 3D, and 2) Interactive adaptive questions in STACK.

## Partners
1. Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet (NTNU) Norway
2. The University Of Edinburgh United Kingdom
3. Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangennürnberg Germany
4. Universitaet Bayreuth Germany
5. Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum Germany

## Work packages

(1) Based on the successes of HELM and FAC, this work package will develop a comprehensive set of online workbooks in the style of "Fundamentals of Algebra and Calculus" for engineering and STEM mathematics based on the previous HELM project workbooks.

(2) Deliver a completely new set of problems for multivariate analysis. This work package is dependent on the programming work package implementing
support for 3D-graphics in STACK.

(3) Software development will focus in two areas: A lightweight 2D-graphics engine for use in mathematical problems and a 3D-graphics engine for STACK through JSXGraph, providing a graphical plugin to STACK that is relatively easy in use and well-documented.
