# Using STACK to put the "book inside the quiz"

This event is associated with the Eurasmus+ IDIAM project.

We have been using, and evaluating, an organising principle for online learning materials which is increasingly guiding our thinking in the development of university mathematics courses. Essentially we have taken the book and put it inside automatically assessed online quizzes. In doing this, we embrace the potential provided by new technology to implement evidence-based practices such as spaced retrieval practice.  This workshop discusses details of this innovation, and show example of courses in which we have implemented it.

**When:** Wednesday 16th November 2022.

**Where:** The University of Edinburgh, James Clerk Maxwell building (morning talks will be streamed as well).

9:00 am - 12:30 pm, JCMB - Room 5323<br/>
