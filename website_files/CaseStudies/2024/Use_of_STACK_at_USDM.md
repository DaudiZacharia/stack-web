# Challenges and Opportunities of Online Teaching with STACK at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), Tanzania

Daudi Amani Zacharia

### Introduction

STACK was first implemented at the University of Dar es salaam for a big class (of almost 950 students) in the 2021/2022 academic year. It was looked at as a 
cost-effective approach to mathematics learning as compared to the classical tutorial sessions that required a lot of staff, and had timetable constraints. 
In that academic year, it was used in two courses: Matrices and Basic Calculus for Non-Majors, and One-Variable Calculus and Differential Equations, both of
which are Engineering courses.
